         The horse is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus.
         it is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equide.
         the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years 
         from a amall multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large,
         single-toed animal of today.
